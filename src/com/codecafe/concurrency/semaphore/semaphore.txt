 Semaphore - The permit machine
--------------------------------

If we want to give access to critical section to multiple threads one at a time then we use a Lock.

But what if we want to give access to more than one threads?

Here we use Semaphore.

Semaphore is nothing but a "permit machine".

We define a Semaphore with number of allowed permits.

So if we define a Semaphore with 3 permits then at a time only 3 threads can work on the CS.

Rest of the threads will wait for the working threads to release the permit.
