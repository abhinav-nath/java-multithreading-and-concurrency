# The `volatile` keyword

_From jenkov.com_

> The Java `volatile` keyword is used to mark a Java variable as "being stored in main memory". More precisely that means, that every read of a `volatile`
> variable will be read from the computer's main memory, and not from the CPU cache, and that every write to a volatile variable will be written to main 
> memory, and not just to the CPU cache.
